I am a postdoc at the [Department of Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at Saarland University.

My research interests lie in multilingualism, linguistics, and translation studies. I’m particularly interested in receptive multilingualism as well as in effects of linguistic and extra-linguistic factors on comprehension of related and unrelated languages.
